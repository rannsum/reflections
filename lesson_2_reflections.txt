Reflect: Staging Area

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it's a temporary queue with out having to move or alter files prior to final decision to commit


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
using git diff, will compare the working directory with the staging area to see what changes that have not yet been staged
using git diff --stage, will compare the stageing area to commit1 so you will see which changes you have in the staging area to yet commit
vs diff status which will show all changes in the working directory

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
if you have an experiment you want to test out but still have a working version. you can continue to make changes to both branches at the same time and beable to keep concurrent changes seperated per branch type.
