How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    limiting to line that were altered, allows for highlight of most importa area

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    save more time, fit more projects and learning

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    human error can for get to save a commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    probably flexibility, maybe a new commit may not be good 2 versions in and revert to later than last commit is needed?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    it will show changes, thus list the histor of the files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you are able to account for changes and know you are introducing less human error to the code changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I do not know yet.
